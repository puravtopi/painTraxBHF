<b>FINAL DIAGNOSES: </b><br/><br/>




#goal


<b>PLAN:</b><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>SCHEDULE LEFT KNEE SURGERY: </b>Treatment options were discussed with the patient, which include living with the problem, conservative management or possible surgery.  As the patient remains symptomatic despite several weeks of conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medications, the patient was given the option to proceed with left knee arthroscopy.  The nature of this type of procedure and expected postoperative course was explained to the patient.  Potential risks and benefits of the proposed surgery were also explained.  Possible complications include, but are not limited to, risks associated with anesthesia, bleeding or infection, potential nerve damage, wound healing issues, failure to achieve pain relief, DVT and PE to name a few, all of which may lead to the need for further surgery.  The patient expresses an understanding of these risks.  All questions and concerns were addressed. The patient indicated that given the severity of their pain and lack of improvement despite conservative management, they would like to move forward with surgery.  As such, the patient will be referred for medical clearance, if necessary, and may schedule the procedure at their convenience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
