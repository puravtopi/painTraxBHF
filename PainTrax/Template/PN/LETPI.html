    Technique: After obtaining informed consent, the patients muscle(s) were
    palpated for the painful area of complaint.
</p>
<p>
    An exquisitely painful area of the above muscles was detected. Palpation
    over this taut band of muscle caused a twitch response and a referred pain
    pattern. At this time, the area was marked and sprayed with topical ethyl
    chloride. The medication combination below was drawn using a 22 gauge 1 ½
    inch needle. The skin was prepped and a 30 gauge 1 inch needle replaced the
    22 gauge needle, which was then introduced through the skin and
    subcutaneous tissues down into the taut band of muscle. After aspiration to
    make sure that the needle was not inside a vessel, a mixture of the
    following medication was injected in the above trigger point regions.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>5 cc of 1% lidocaine _1_cc of 40mg/cc of DepoMedrol</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The mixture was injected after aspiration was negative for blood or air.
    The ultrasound machine was also used to visualize the medication going past
    the adipose tissue and into the muscles to avoid any vulnerable areas such
    as arteries, veins and nerves. After aspiration to make sure that the
    needle was not inside a vessel, a mixture of the following medication was
    injected in the above trigger point regions. As no fluid was aspirated out,
    no sample was sent to the lab for cytology.
</p>
<p>
    The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged without
    complications. This should stand for the letter of medical necessity for
    the requested procedure. <u></u>
