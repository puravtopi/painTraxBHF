<b>PHYSICAL EXAM:</b>
<p>
    Examination of the face and head reveals no abnormalities. Examination of the neck is supple with no JVD or palpable masses along the thyroid and other areas. Examination of the cardiovascular system reveals the heart to have a regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 are heard without splits. On auscultation, there are no obvious murmurs or clicks. Examination of the pulmonary system reveals both lung fields to be clear to auscultation. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes are heard. The abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended with bowel sounds present in all four quadrants. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness bilaterally. The radial, brachial, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are present bilaterally and symmetrical.
</p>


<p>
    <b>
        NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
    </b> The mental status examination reveals the patient to be awake, alert and oriented to time, person and place. Higher cortical functions such as language skills, calculations and short and long term memory are intact. Patient is alert and cooperative and responding appropriately. Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        CRANIAL NERVE EXAMINATION:
    </b> Reveals both pupils to be reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements are full without lateral nystagmus.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        COORDINATION:
    </b> There is no dysmetria to finger to nose and heel to shin examination and no evidence of ataxia nor dysdiadochokinesis.
</p>




<b>CERVICAL SPINE EXAMINATION: </b>
        The cervical spine exam reveals tenderness upon palpation at
    C2-C7 levels, on the right.   ROM is as follows: forward flexion is 1 degrees, normal is 50 degrees; extension is 2 degrees, normal is 60 degrees; left rotation is 1 degrees, normal is 120 degrees; left lateral flexion is 1 degrees, normal is 30 degrees;  right rotation is 1 degrees, normal is 120 degrees; right lateral flexion is 1 degrees, normal is 30 degrees. There are palpable taut bands/trigger points at  left paraspinal 1, right rhomboids 2, Bilateral trapezius 3. <br/><br/>        Tender (+) interspinous region, at facets C-7 bilaterally.  Axial cervical facet loading positive bilaterally, neck pain worse on extension and lateral rotation of the cervical spine bilaterally.  Cervical Rigidity (+).  Muscle spasms (+).  Trigger points identified at bilateral cervical paraspinal muscles and Trapezius muscles -taut bands with discrete, hyperirritable, tender spots, with palpation induced muscle twitches and pain referred to shoulders<br/><br/>
<b>THORACIC SPINE EXAMINATION: </b> The thoracic spine exam reveals tenderness upon palpation at T1-T12 levels mildly decreased.   There are palpable taut bands/trigger points at  bilateral paraspinal 1, bilateral rhomboids 2, bilateral trapezius 3, bilateral serratus posterior superior 4. <br/><br/>
<b>LUMBAR SPINE EXAMINATION: </b> The lumbar spine exam reveals tenderness upon palpation at  L1-S1 levels  There are palpable taut bands/trigger points at  bilateral paraspinal 2. <br/><br/>








<b>GAIT: </b>has a normal gait pattern.<br/>
<br />


<b>DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: </b><br/>01/01/2000 -  MRI of the  Cervical spine 1123, HNP at 234.234.<br/><br/>




<b>CARE: </b> Acupuncture, Chiropratic and  Demo.<br/><br/>
<b>PRECAUTIONS: </b>If the patient continues to have tender palpable taut bands/trigger points with referral patterns as noted in the future on examination, I will consider doing trigger point injections. <br/><br/>
<b>GOALS: </b>To increase range of motion, strength, flexibility, to decrease pain and to improve body biomechanics and activities of daily living and improve the functional status.<br/><br/>
<b>PRECAUTIONS: </b>All the treatment options have been discussed with the patient in detail. Pain management compliance was discussed with patient.Patient may need urine toxicology for the possibility of prescribing controlled medicine because pain still complains of pain affecting activities of daily living. Pain contract signed in chart. Patient understood and agrees with the plan. , physician, printed material.<br/><br/>
<b>FOLLOW-UP: </b>2 weeks<br/><br/>
