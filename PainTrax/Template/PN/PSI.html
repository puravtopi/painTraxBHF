        Diagnosis: Myofascial pain syndrome M79.1, Myofascial trigger point
        M79.1, Muscle Spasms M62.83, Piriformis syndrome G57.01.

    <p>
        Procedure: (side) side Piriformus injection / Trigger point injection
        of the
    </p>
    <p>
        _<a name="L51"></a>X_L5-S1 paraspinal muscle(s) _X_Glutus maximus
        _X_Piriformus muscle
    </p>
    <p>
        Technique: After obtaining informed consent, the patients muscle(s)
        were palpated for the painful area of complaint. The ultrasound was
        positioned then also at the the lateral side medial to the greater
        trochanter and it's medial side lateral to the ischial tuberosity. In
        this position the siatric nerve was identified as a oval honeycombed
        structure with mixed echogenicity. The probe was positioned parallel to
        the piriformis fibers where the needle was in plane orientation. The
        needle was advanced under ultrasound visualization, traversing the
        gluteus maximus and piriformis muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
        An exquisitely painful area of the above muscles was detected.
        Palpation over this taut band of muscle caused a twitch response and a
        referred pain pattern. At this time, the area was marked. The
        medication combination below was drawn using a 22 gauge 1 ½ inch
        needle. The skin was prepped and a 27 gauge 1 1/4 inch needle replaced
        the 22 gauge needle, which was then introduced through the skin and
        subcutaneous tissues down into the taut band of muscle. After
        aspiration to make sure that the needle was not inside a vessel, a
        mixture of the following medication was injected in the above trigger
        point regions.

        _1_ cc of 40mg/cc depomedrol

    The mixture was injected after aspiration was negative for blood or air.
    The patient tolerated the procedure well with no adverse events. This
    medication was evenly distributed between the above muscles.
