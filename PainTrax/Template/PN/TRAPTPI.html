    <strong>PROCEDURE:</strong>
    Trigger point injection of the <a name="C34"></a>(side) trapezius muscles
    under ultrasound guidance.
</p>
<p>
    Technique: After obtaining informed consent, the patients (side) trapezius
    muscle was palpated for the painful area of complaint.
</p>
<p>
    The patient was seated in an upright position. The trapezius was cleansed
    with alcohol prep pad. The medication combination below was drawn using a 5
    mL sterile syringe with a 27gauge one and a half inch sterile needle. The
    syringe was held at a 90° angle and advanced into the trapezius. The
    plunger was aspirated and no blood was drawn back into the syringe. The
    plunger of the syringe was pushed forward to inject content of syringe into
    the trapezius. Needle and syringe were retracted from the trapezius.

    The mixture was injected after
    <strong>
        <u>aspiration was negative for blood or air.</u>
        The ultrasound machine was also used to visualize the medication going
        into the muscles to avoid any vulnerable areas such as arteries, veins
        and nerves
    </strong>
    . After aspiration to make sure that the needle was not inside a vessel, a
    mixture of the following medication was injected in the above trigger point
    regions. As no fluid was aspirated out, no sample was sent to the lab for
    cytology.
</p>
<p>
    A bandage was placed over injection site. The patient tolerated the
    procedure well and was discharged without complications.
</p>
<p>
    This should stand for the letter of medical necessity for the requested
    procedure. <u></u>
