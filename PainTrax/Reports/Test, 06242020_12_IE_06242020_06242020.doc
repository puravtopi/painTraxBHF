<b>GAIT: </b>Antalgic.<br/>

<b>DIAGNOSES: </b><br/>Carpal tunnel syndrome, right upper limb<br/>Carpal tunnel syndrome, left upper limb<br/>Left ankle sprain/strain<br/><br/>

<br/><b>RECOMMENDATIONS: </b><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>Request X-Rays of the cervical spine: </b>to rule out herniated nucleus pulposus/soft tissue injury.<br/><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>Schedule NCV/EMG of the UE: </b>The patient has had conservative care for several months, the patient has also tried and failed conservative care, with not sufficient pain relief.  Given the patients MRI and physical findings, I'm scheduling the upper extremity EMG/NCV to help me 1. Localize the damage 2. Help me confirm if it is acute or chronic 3. Help me see if there actually exists electrophysiologic/ neurologic element to the pain, and help me differentiate between neuromuscular disorders as well as  discogenic and non discogenic radiculopathies, peripheral neuropathies, plexopathies and entrapment syndromes, by helping me assess the suspected nerve roots and peripheral nerves.<br/><br/><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>Request thoracic medial branch block at (side) (level) #2: </b>The patient has a persistent, NON-ACUTE non-radiating midback pain, worse with extension and side bending. Despite an attempted but overall limited success of completing the initial therapy which includes modalities and active exercises and anti-inflammatory medications, the patient continues to have midback pain.  I will perform a diagnostic thoracic medial branch block (anesthetic only without steroids) #2 as the first medial branch block was positive.  The current guidelines require a second confirmatory medial branch block to avoid false positives, and will be necessary to evaluate for thoracic facetogenic pain.  The medial branch block injection may aid in identifying pain generators at the facet joints and if positive will determine a need for radiofrequency ablation. I request the medial branch block #2 at bilateral at (level) levels.  Only if the second Medial branch blocks is also positive (providing for a temporary pain relief for at least 1-4 hours of pain relief from the anesthetic), will I proceed with a radiofrequency ablation. If the second medial branch block is negative, I will re-evaluate the patient for the next best likely diagnosis.<br/><br/><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>Procedure - (side) lumbar trigger point injection: </b>Because the patient presents with tender palpable taut bands/trigger points with referral patterns as noted on today’s exam, and the patient has had conservative care with several  weeks of physical therapy along with anti-inflammatories, I have performed trigger point injection under ultrasound guidance those noted trigger points under ultrasound guidance on those noted trigger points.  This injection should decrease pain and inflammation and assist the therapist to obtain an increase in range of motion to expedite recovery.<br/><br/>


<b>GOALS: </b>To increase range of motion, strength, flexibility, to decrease pain and to improve body biomechanics and activities of daily living and improve the functional status.<br/><br/>
