    <strong>PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS</strong>
    : Left hip degenerative joint disease.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>POST OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </strong>
    Left hip degenerative joint disease
</p>
<p>
    <strong>INJECTION PROCEDURE:</strong>
    Left hip intracapsular arthrogram.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>ALLERGIES: NKDA</strong>

<p>
    <strong>COMPLICATIONS: </strong>
    None.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: </strong>
    The patient was identified and was found to be stable. Because the patient
    reports that the pain still continues, the indication for the procedure
    persists.
</p>
<p>
    The patient was placed in the supine position. The injection field was
    prepped and draped with Betadine three times. The needle used was a 22
    gauge spinal needle, 5 inches long.
</p>
<p>
    The femoral head was identified clinically and verified fluoroscopically.
    Fluoroscopy was used to guide the needle over the femoral head of the left
    hip. An arthrogram was performed after negative aspiration for blood was
    confirmed. The dye pattern was consistent with an outline of the
    intracapsular arthrogram.
