    <strong>Diagnosis:</strong>
    Bursitis of left trochanteric bursa M70.61.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>COMPLICATIONS: </strong>
    None.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Technique: </strong>
    The patient was identified and was found to be stable. Because the patient
    reports that the pain still continues, the indication for the procedure
    persists.
</p>
<p>
    The patient was placed in the lateral decubitus position. The injection
    field was prepped and draped with Betadine three times. The needle used was
    a 27 gauge, 1 1/4 inch long. The greater trochanteric bursa was identified
    clinically and verified via ultrasound guidance. After aspiration to make
    sure that the needle was not inside a vessel, a mixture of the following
    medication was injected in the bursa. The ultrasound machine was also used
    to visualize the medication going past the adipose tissue and into the
    bursa and to avoid any vulnerable areas such as vessels near by. Ultrasound
    was used live to guide the needle into the greater trochanteric bursa. At
    that point, an injection was performed on the left side using 1cc of 40 mg
    of Depomedrol and 4 cc of 1% Lidocaine, under sterile procedure. After
    aspiration to make sure that the needle was not inside a vessel, a mixture
    of the following medication was injected in the above trigger point
    regions.
</p>
<p>
    The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged from the office
    in stable condition.
</p>
<p>
    This should stand as the letter of medical necessity for the requested
    procedure. <u></u>
