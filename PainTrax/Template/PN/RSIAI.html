        <strong>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</strong>
        Right shoulder impingement syndrome

        <strong>INJECTION PROCEDURE:</strong>
        <a name="subacromialaspect1"></a>
        Right shoulder intra-articular steroid injection with Ultrasound
        Guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: </strong>
        The patient was identified and was found to be stable. Because the
        patient reports that the pain still continues, with positive physical
        findings and positive MRI findings, the indication for the procedure
        persists.
    </p>
    <p>
        The patient was put in the appropriate position. Ethyl chloride was
        sprayed over the region to be injected to allow for a numbing effect. A
        22 gauge 1 ½ inch needle was used to draw up the combination of
        medication. The injection field was prepped and draped with Betadine
        three times. The 22 gauge needle was replaced with a smaller 27 gauge
        spinal needle, 1.25 inches needle for better patient comfort, and less
        pain.
    </p>
    <p>
        The posterior interspace between the acromion and the superior aspect
        of the humeral head was identified clinically and verified via
        ultrasound technique. Ultrasound was used to guide the needle into the
        subacromial bursa and negative aspiration of blood was confirmed.
        Subsequently a subacromial injection into the shoulder was performed
        under sterile procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well and
        was discharged without complications.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this time the following mixture of medication was injected in the
        joint.
