    <strong>Chief Complaint: </strong>
    Low back pain
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Diagnosis: </strong>
    Sacroiliac pain, Sacroiliitis
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Procedure:</strong>
    (Side) Sacroiliac joint injection with ultrasound guidance
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Description Of Procedure:</strong>
    The patient was identified and was found to be stable. Because the patient
    reports that the pain still continues despite conservative care, and given
    the MRI findings and physical exam, the indication for the procedure
    persists.
</p>
<p>
    The patient was put in the prone position. The medication combination below
    was drawn using a 22 gauge 1 ½ inch needle. The injection field was prepped
    with Betadine three times. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were
    anesthetized with 1% lidocaine, with a skin wheal was showing. A 22 gauge
    spinal needle was then advanced to the (side) sacroiliac joint under
    ultrasound guidance. The interspace between the sacrum and the illum was
    identified clinically and verified via ultrasound guidance technique.
    <em>
        Ultrasound was used to guide the needle into the intra-articular joint
        space and negative aspiration of blood was confirmed.
    </em>
    Subsequently an intra-articular injection into the SI joint was performed
    under sterile technique. At this time the following mixture of medication
    was injected in the joint:
</p>
<p>
    A 3 cc solution of mixed with 1cc of 2% lidocaine, and 2 cc of 6 mg of
    Celestone, was then injected into the joint.
</p>
<p>
    The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged without
    complications. This should stand for the letter of medical necessity for
    the requested procedure. <u></u>
