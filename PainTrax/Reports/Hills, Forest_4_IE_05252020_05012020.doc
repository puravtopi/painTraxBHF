<b><u>TREATMENT/PLAN:</u></b>
<br />
<!--moist heat application,ice pack application,electric stimulation in low voltage,Treatment will begin ____ times a week for ____ weeks. The patient will be reevaluated in approximately ____ weeks, at which point in time I will assess the progress with physical therapy (and review the diagnostics that I have requested). It is my opinion the injuries sustained are causally related to the accident as described by the patient.<br/>-->
<br/><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>Request cervical trigger point injections x3: </b>Because the patient presents with tender palpable taut bands/trigger points with referral patterns as noted on today's exam, and the patient has had conservative care with several  weeks of physical therapy along with anti-inflammatories, I  would like to request trigger point injections under ultrasound guidance those noted trigger points under ultrasound guidance on those noted trigger points.  This injection should decrease pain and inflammation and assist the therapist to obtain an increase in range of motion to expedite recovery.<br/><br/><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>Schedule Lumbar (levels) Interlaminar Epidural Steroid Injection: </b>Due to ongoing pain despite conservative measures and based on symptoms, physical exam findings, and relevant diagnostic testing, the procedure is medically appropriate and necessary and hence scheduled.<br/><br/>
<b>Care: </b> Acupuncture, Chiropratic and  Demo.<br/><br/>
<b>Procedures: </b>If the patient continues to have tender palpable taut bands/trigger points with referral patterns as noted in the future on examination, I will consider doing trigger point injections. <br/><br/>
<b>Goals: </b>To increase range of motion, strength, flexibility, to decrease pain and to improve body biomechanics and activities of daily living and improve the functional status.<br/><br/>
<b>Precautions: </b>Universal, Cardiac and  Weight Bearing. Patient education provided via, physician , printed material, online website references.<br/><br/>
<b>Follow up: </b>1 week<br/><br/>
