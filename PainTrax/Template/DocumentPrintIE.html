    Examination of the face and head reveals no abnormalities. Examination of the neck is supple with no JVD or palpable masses along the thyroid and other areas. Examination of the cardiovascular system reveals the heart to have a regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 are heard without splits. On auscultation, there are no obvious murmurs or clicks. Examination of the pulmonary system reveals both lung fields to be clear to auscultation. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes are heard. The abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended with bowel sounds present in all four quadrants. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness bilaterally. The radial, brachial, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are present bilaterally and symmetrical.

<p>It is my opinion that the injuries and symptoms Mr. Woody Byron sustained to neck, low back and left knee are causally related to the incident that occurred on 04/04/2020 as described by the patient.</p>
