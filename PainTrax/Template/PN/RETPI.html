    Technique: After obtaining informed consent, the patients muscle(s) were
    palpated for the painful area of complaint.
</p>
<p>
    An exquisitely painful area of the above muscles was detected. Palpation
    over this taut band of muscle caused a twitch response and a referred pain
    pattern. At this time, the area was marked and sprayed with topical ethyl
    chloride. The medication combination below was drawn using a 22 gauge 1 ½
    inch needle. The skin was prepped and a 30 gauge 1 inch needle replaced the
    22 gauge needle, which was then introduced through the skin and
    subcutaneous tissues down into the taut band of muscle. After aspiration to
    make sure that the needle was not inside a vessel, a mixture of the
    following medication was injected in the above trigger point regions.

<p>
    The mixture was injected after aspiration was
    <strong>
        <u>negative for blood or air</u>
        . The ultrasound machine was also used to visualize the medication
        going past the adipose tissue and into the muscles to avoid any
        vulnerable areas such as arteries, veins and nerves.
    </strong>
    After aspiration to make sure that the needle was not inside a vessel, a
    mixture of the following medication was injected in the above trigger point
    regions. As no fluid was aspirated out, no sample was sent to the lab for
    cytology.
</p>
<p>
    The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged without
    complications. This should stand for the letter of medical necessity for
    the requested procedure. <u></u>
